        <p> Playing football is my favourite hobby. I like to play football as it is an outdoor game. There are many advantages of playing football such as increase of stamina and increase in reflexes and skill. Another advantage of playing football is that you only need one thing to play football - a ball. Playing football really makes the day for a person. .</p>
